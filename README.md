# PLANT-DIESEASE-DETECTION-
 Plant Disease Detection
📌 Overview
This project is a deep learning-based system that detects plant diseases from leaf images.
It helps farmers, gardeners, and agricultural researchers identify diseases early and take preventive measures.

🚀 Features
Detects multiple plant diseases from leaf images.

Supports real-time detection via webcam or uploaded image.

Trained on a labeled dataset of healthy and diseased leaves.

Provides predicted disease name and possible treatment suggestions.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras – Model training & prediction

OpenCV – Image preprocessing & real-time capture

NumPy & Pandas – Data handling

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization

📂 Dataset
Public dataset from PlantVillage (or specify your dataset).

Contains images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

📊 Model
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.

Trained for X epochs achieving Y% accuracy (replace X & Y).

Supports image upload and live camera detection.
